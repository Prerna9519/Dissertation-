It has since been eliminated. We have quarantined the infected server and reinforced all relevant system structures.”The affected users entered their card information on OnePlus’s store between mid-November and January. Customers who made purchases with a saved card “should not” be affected, OnePlus said. The same goes for ones who paid with PayPal or credit card via PayPal. Affected users will be offered a year of credit monitoring.
